# Q&A Chatbot using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

## ðŸ“Œ Project Description

This project implements a **Q&A chatbot** based on **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**. The RAG architecture combines information retrieval and text generation to enhance the chatbot's ability to provide accurate and contextually relevant answers. This chatbot retrieves relevant information from a knowledge base using embeddings, then generates answers with a **DeepSeek R1 model** via the **Groq API**. The entire system is implemented using the **LangChain framework** in Python, which provides the tools to build modular and scalable AI applications.

## ðŸš€ Tech Stack

This project uses the following technologies:

- **Python**: The primary programming language for the implementation (Recommended version: 3.8+).
- **LangChain**: A framework for building applications that use language models in a modular and scalable manner. It is used to implement the RAG architecture.
- **Ollama**: A service used to create **embeddings** (vector representations of text) that are essential for information retrieval.
- **DeepSeek R1 Model**: A generative model that produces natural language responses, used here for generating chatbot answers.
- **Groq API**: An API to access the **DeepSeek R1 model** for generating responses.
